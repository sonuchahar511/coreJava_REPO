2- forEach() method in Iterable interface
3- Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
4- Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
5- Java Time API
6- Collection API improvements
7- Concurrency API improvements
8- Java IO improvements
9- Miscellaneous Core API improvements.

==================================================================================================

1- default and static methods in Interfaces
foreach() defined in Iterable interface but we know that interfaces canâ€™t have method body.
From Java 8, interfaces are enhanced to have method with implementation.
We can use default and static keyword to create interfaces with method implementation.

    Differences between static and default methods in Java 8:
        Default methods can be overriden in implementing class, while static cannot.
        Static method belongs only to Interface class.( similar to static field - Interface class object).
        static member(field& method) are part of interface. Overriding is not possible with static object.


2- forEach() method in Iterable interface.
forEach method implementation in Iterable interface is:

    default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(action);
        for (T t : this) {
            action.accept(t);
        }
    }

3- Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions.
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit.
lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface.

functional interface can have a number of default methods but only one abstract method.

Question: Performance difference forloop, for each loop, foreach method
